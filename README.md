# Zane Portfolio Starter

This is a minimal Next.js + Tailwind CSS starter for your personal site.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Where to Edit First

- `app/page.tsx` – home/landing content.
- `app/research/page.tsx` – add your research summary, posters, and figures.
- `app/projects/page.tsx` – plug in your real projects, GitHub links, and PDFs.
- `app/coursework/page.tsx` – refine the thematic coursework groupings.
- `app/resume/page.tsx` – embed or link your resume PDF (place it in `/public`).
- `app/contact/page.tsx` – add your GitHub and any other links.

You can customize styling via Tailwind classes and `app/globals.css`.
